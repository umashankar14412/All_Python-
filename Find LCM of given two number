Write a JavaScript program to find and display least common multiple of two whole numbers.
Least Common Multiple of two numbers, say num1 and num2, is the smallest positive number that is divisible by both num1 and num2.

program:


num1=5
num2=10
if num1>num2:

    min1=num1
    
else:
    min1=num2

while(1):

    if min1%num1==0 and min1%num2==0:
        print("LCM is:",min1)
        break
    
    min1=min1+1
